Task1:
The query is returning reault as expected and saving it in a view.

Project file for task 2.
This program has a executor which is performing currently a filter transformation.
--File path and filter are given based on local system, it would change based on the environment and path where the .jsoon file stores.
--.jar file needs to generate to submit the spark

I couldnâ€™t do the task in pyspark as my personal laptop is not supporting the confirmation setup for pyspark.
Also I did not use S3 to read .json again with the same setup issue.
I have done similar jobs in my work Place in pyspark but never in my personal laptop so facing issues with setup.
Also i Never prefer to breach any compliance aspects so showing work done in Office wont be possible .

--I can do it better if i have proper environment.
